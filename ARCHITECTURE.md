- Consolidated `connectionStore`, `obsStore`, and `streamerBotStore` into a single `connectionManagerStore` to eliminate synchronization issues and provide a single source of truth for connection state.
- Improved API key management UI in `AdvancedPanel.tsx` to include a visibility toggle for API keys and clearer indications for required vs. optional keys.
- Refactored `ImageGeneration.tsx` and `MusicGeneration.tsx` to align with API key management updates and use the consolidated `useConnectionManagerStore`.

# Google GenAI SDK Migration Summary

This document summarizes the changes made to ensure the project is using the updated Google GenAI SDK as per the [migration guide](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/migrate).

## Overview

The project has been updated to align with the new Google GenAI SDK patterns, which provide a more centralized client architecture and improved developer experience.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Dependencies

**Frontend (package.json):**
- Already using the new SDK: `"@google/genai": "^1.13.0"`

**Backend (requirements.txt):**
- Updated to ensure compatibility: `google-genai>=1.31.0`

### 2. Backend Implementation Updates

**File: `backend/api/routes/gemini.py`**

Updated to use the new SDK patterns:

1. **Import Changes:**
   - Changed from `import google.generativeai as genai` to `from google import genai`
   - Added `from google.genai import types` for configuration types

2. **Client Initialization:**
   - Updated to use the new centralized client pattern:
     ```python
     client = genai.Client(api_key=api_key)
     ```

3. **API Calls:**
   - Updated to use the new centralized API access pattern:
     ```python
     response = client.models.generate_content(
         model=request.model,
         contents=contents, 
         config=generation_config
     )
     ```

4. **Configuration:**
   - Using the new `types.GenerateContentConfig` for configuration instead of the old `GenerationConfig`

### 3. Proxy Service

**File: `proxy.mjs`**
- Already using the new JavaScript SDK patterns with `GoogleGenAI` client

## Benefits of the Migration

1. **Centralized API Access:**
   - All API services (models, chats, files, etc.) are accessed through a single client object
   - Simplifies credential and configuration management

2. **Consistent Interface:**
   - Uniform patterns across all supported platforms (Python, JavaScript, Go)
   - More predictable API usage

3. **Improved Maintainability:**
   - Easier to manage and update client configurations
   - Clearer separation of concerns

## Verification

The changes have been verified by checking that:
1. All dependencies are using the new SDK versions
2. Backend code follows the new client patterns
3. Frontend code was already using the new SDK patterns
4. No syntax errors were introduced

## Next Steps

No further action is required. The project is now fully aligned with the Google GenAI SDK migration guide.
